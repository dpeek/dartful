  <div><p>The <a href="http://www.dartlang.org/downloads.html">documentation</a> of the Dart website for installation and setup is 
great, and since I didn't have any problems I don't have much to add. In no 
time at all, I was skimming through the tutorials, playing with futures from 
dart:async and writting my first HelloWorld HttpServer with rikulo. Rikulo 
introduced the idea of a project <code>build.dart</code> where I could define build tasks, 
A good place to start roughing out the peices of my blog engine.</p></div>

  <div><p>This blog documents my experiences learning <a href="http://www.dartlang.org">Dart</a>, getting to know the 
<a href="http://www.dartlang.org/docs/spec">language</a>, <a href="http://www.dartlang.org/docs/dart-up-and-running/contents/ch03.html">libraries</a>, <a href="http://www.dartlang.org/docs/editor">toolchain</a>, and 
<a href="https://groups.google.com/a/dartlang.org/forum">community</a>. As a learning project I'll be building a simple static 
site generator similar to <a href="http://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a>. I don't have big plans for the 
project, but hopefully others will find it a useful reference.</p>
