  <div><p>This blog documents my experiences learning [Dart][dart], getting to know the 
[language][spec], [libraries][core], [toolchain][editor], and 
[community][community]. As a learning project I'll be building a simple static 
site generator similar to [Jekyll][jekyll]. I don't have big plans for the 
project, but hopefully others will find it a useful reference.</p>
<p>The source for this site is available on [GitHub][source].</p></div>

  <div><p>The [documentation][install] of the Dart website for installation and setup is 
great, and since I didn't have any problems I don't have much to add. In no 
time at all, I was skimming through the tutorials, playing with futures from 
dart:async and writting my first HelloWorld HttpServer with rikulo. Rikulo 
introduced the idea of a project <code>build.dart</code> where I could define build tasks, 
A good place to start roughing out the peices of my blog engine.</p></div>
