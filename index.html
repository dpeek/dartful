  <div><p>Minor detour. My questions on the <a href="https://groups.google.com/a/dartlang.org/forum/#!topic/misc/q79EMVtD2Xg">dart mailing list</a> have lead to my 
first library on <a href="http://pub.dartlang.org/packages/markdown">pub.dartlang.org</a>. While I can't take credit for the 
code (I think <a href="https://github.com/munificent">Bob Nystrom</a> wrote most of it), I'm happy to make 
myself useful by maintaining and building on it.</p>
<p>Extracting the library from Dartdoc meant removing support for Dart syntax 
highlighting. Fortunately, with some pointers from the list, I've written a 
new Dart classifier based on <a href="http://pub.dartlang.org/packages/analyzer_experimental">analyzer_experimental</a>. HTML/CSS 
classifiers are also <a href="https://github.com/dpeek/dart-markdown/tree/feature/classify-html">in the works</a>.</p>
<p>The project is <a href="http://github.com/dpeek/dart-markdown">located here</a>, and there is a editor demo running 
on <a href="http://dpeek.github.com/dart-markdown">GitHub pages</a>. Pull requests, feedback and issues welcome.</p></div>

  <div><p>The <a href="http://www.dartlang.org/downloads.html">installation instructions</a> on the Dart website are great, and 
since I didn't have any issues I don't have much to add. In no time at all I 
was skimming through tutorials, playing with futures from dart:async and 
writing my first HelloWorld HttpServer with Rikulo. Rikulo introduced the idea 
of a project <code>build.dart</code> where I could define build tasks, A good place to 
start roughing out the pieces of the blog engine.</p></div>

  <div><p>This blog documents my experience learning <a href="http://www.dartlang.org">Dart</a>, getting to know the 
<a href="http://www.dartlang.org/docs/spec">language</a>, <a href="http://www.dartlang.org/docs/dart-up-and-running/contents/ch03.html">libraries</a>, <a href="http://www.dartlang.org/docs/editor">toolchain</a>, and 
<a href="https://groups.google.com/a/dartlang.org/forum">community</a>. As a learning project I'll be building a simple static 
site generator similar to <a href="http://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a>. I don't have big plans for the 
project, but hopefully others will find it a useful reference.</p>
