      <div><p>Minor detour. My questions on the <a href="https://groups.google.com/a/dartlang.org/forum/#!topic/misc/q79EMVtD2Xg">dart mailing list</a> have lead to my 
first library on <a href="http://pub.dartlang.org/packages/markdown">pub.dartlang.org</a>. While I can't take credit for the 
code (I think <a href="https://github.com/munificent">Bob Nystrom</a> wrote most of it), I'm happy to make 
myself useful by maintaining and building on it.</p>
<p>Extracting the library from Dartdoc meant removing support for Dart syntax 
highlighting. Fortunately, with some pointers from the list, I've written a 
new Dart classifier based on <a href="http://pub.dartlang.org/packages/analyzer_experimental">analyzer_experimental</a>. HTML/CSS 
classifiers are also <a href="https://github.com/dpeek/dart-markdown/tree/feature/classify-html">in the works</a>.</p>
<p>The project is <a href="http://github.com/dpeek/dart-markdown">located here</a>, and there is a editor demo running 
on <a href="http://dpeek.github.com/dart-markdown">GitHub pages</a>. Pull requests, feedback and issues welcome.</p></div>
